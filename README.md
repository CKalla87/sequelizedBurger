# Eat-Da-Burger
A restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

1. Install all the npm packages needed. Please visit site: https://floating-reef-10843.herokuapp.com/

2. You will be given the option to "Destroy It" which is adding a burger to the "Burgers That Have Been Eaten" list.

3. Under the header "Add A Burger!" you will be able to input a new name for a burger and submit the order by clicking the button.

4. Once the order has been submitted it will show in the "Burgers Available To Eat" section.

5. You will then be able to click the "Destroy It" button for those burgers as well to add them to the "Burgers That Have Been Eaten!"

Enjoy!
